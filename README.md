Card game assignment - Group 3

Project Description 
For the Blackjack game our group has designed we have decided to incorporate a version of the game where the user
of the game program will be able to face off against a dealer for three rounds. The game will keep continue based upon 
the rules established in the game of blackjack. There the players will be able to hold onto the cards they are dealt or continue
to receive cards which represents the respective player through a total sum value. If they win, and in turn beat the dealer they
will accrue a total score. After the three rounds the player with the highest score wins and the game will terminate. 


Blackjack Game Rules 

1. Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks.
2. Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as ten points.
3. The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands.
4. After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card."

5. If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing then he will peek at his facedown card to see if he has a blackjack. If he does, then he will turn it over immediately.
7. If the dealer does have a blackjack, then all wagers will lose.
8. Play begins with the player to the dealer's left. The following are the choices available to the player:
   - Stand: Player stands pat with his cards.
   - Hit: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses.

9. Surrender: The player forfeits half his wager, keeping the other half, and does not play out his hand. 
10. After each player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card.
11. If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.
12. If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.
